Sub Link_Filter()

'Created by Tom Williams

    Dim c As Range
    Dim WorkRng As Range

'This part asks you to select a range:

    xTitleId = "Select a range to open"
    Set WorkRng = Selection
    Set WorkRng = Application.InputBox(xTitleId, xTitleId, WorkRng.Address, Type:=8)
    
'This part deletes everything that isn't a hyperlink:

    If Not WorkRng Is Nothing Then
        For Each c In WorkRng
            If c.Hyperlinks.Count = 0 Then
                c.Clear
            End If
        Next c
    End If

'And this part deletes all the blank cells and shifts them up:

    For Each c In WorkRng
        c.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeBlanks).Delete
    Next c

End Sub
